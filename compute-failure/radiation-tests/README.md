# Radiation Test Data

Unfortunately, not all research organizations make their data easily accessible.
Instead, data is published as screenshots of charts and authors do not answer emails.
Why?

We took the liberty to pull out data from some of these papers using [Plot Digitizer](https://plotdigitizer.com/app):

1. [Fig.3 Heavy Ion SEL cross section vs LET](./sa8155p-ion-sefi.csv) from [Radiation Effects Characterization and System Architecture Options for the 7nm Snapdragon SA8155P Automotive Grade System on Chip (SoC)](https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/56137)
1. [Figure 3: Cross section for crashes of Snapdragon 820 DUTs during heavy ion exposure](./820-ion-crash.csv) from [SEE Test Results for the Snapdragon 820](https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/47483)
1. [Figure 4: Limiting cross section for register SBUs in the Snapdragon 820](./820-ion-register-sbu.csv) from [SEE Test Results for the Snapdragon 820](https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/47483)
1. [Figure 5: Limiting cross section for memory SBUs in the Snapdragon 820](./820-ion-memory-sbu.csv) from [SEE Test Results for the Snapdragon 820](https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/47483)
1. [Figure 6: Cross section for SBUs in the Hynix DDR4 device](./skh-ion-memory-sbu.csv) from [SEE Test Results for the Snapdragon 820](https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/47483)
1. [Figure 7: Proton sensitivity of the Open-Q Snapdragon 820 boards to crashes](./820-proton-crash.csv) from [SEE Test Results for the Snapdragon 820](https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/47483)
